# MLB All-Star Prediction Project

## Introduction:
Our project focuses on predicting whether a Major League Baseball (MLB) player will make the All-Star Team the following year based on their past season's performance. While recognizing the influence of subjective factors, we hypothesize that a player's performance is a key predictor. Leveraging Kaggle datasets containing batting and pitching statistics, we aim to develop a statistical learning model for this prediction task.

## Datasets:

* Batting Dataset: 992 rows, 29 columns, encompassing crucial metrics like At-bat (AB), Runs Batted In (RBI), and Batting Average (BA).

* Pitching Dataset: 1081 rows, 35 columns, featuring essential metrics such as Earned Run Average (ERA) and Innings Pitched (IP). Explore metrics here.

## Applications:
This analysis provides valuable insights for team managers/coaches in player selection and resource allocation. Additionally, Fantasy Baseball enthusiasts can use the model for draft decisions. The performance of our models is reliant on high-quality, MLB-owned datasets, ensuring accuracy in predicting All-Star potential.

## Ethical Considerations:
While data integrity is prioritized, ethical implications exist. Decisions based on the model could impact a player's career trajectory. We acknowledge and address the responsibility in handling predictions that may influence resource allocation and attention within a team.
